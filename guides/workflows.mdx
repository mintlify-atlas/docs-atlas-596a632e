# Workflows

Workflows allow you to save and share component installation configurations. Instead of typing long commands with many flags, you can create a workflow once and share it as a short hash or YAML file.

## What are Workflows?

A workflow is a saved configuration that includes:

- **Components** - Agents, commands, MCPs, settings, hooks
- **Properties** - Name, description, tags
- **Metadata** - Author, version, installation instructions

Workflows can be:
- Shared via short hash URLs (`#abc123def456`)
- Saved as YAML files for version control
- Generated from the workflow builder UI
- Created manually in any text editor

## Workflow Hash Installation

Workflow hashes are short identifiers (12 characters) that reference saved workflows.

<Steps>

### Create a Workflow

Visit [aitmpl.com/workflows](https://aitmpl.com/workflows) and use the visual workflow builder:

1. Drag components from the sidebar
2. Arrange them in desired order
3. Click "Generate Workflow"
4. Fill in workflow properties (name, description)
5. Get your workflow hash

### Use the Workflow Hash

```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow:#abc123def456
```

The CLI:
1. Fetches the workflow from localStorage (browser-cached workflows)
2. Parses the component list
3. Installs all components in order
4. Shows installation summary

### Share the Hash

Share the workflow URL with teammates:

```
https://aitmpl.com/workflows#abc123def456
```

They can view the workflow details and install it.

</Steps>

<Note>
**Hash Storage**: Workflow hashes are stored in your browser's localStorage when created on aitmpl.com. The CLI can only install workflows you've created on your machine or workflows shared via YAML.
</Note>

## YAML Workflow Format

YAML workflows are more flexible and can be version-controlled.

### Basic YAML Structure

```yaml workflow.yaml
name: "Full-Stack Development Setup"
description: "Complete setup for full-stack web development"
tags:
  - development
  - full-stack
  - web

steps:
  - step: 1
    type: agent
    name: "frontend-developer"
  
  - step: 2
    type: agent
    name: "backend-developer"
  
  - step: 3
    type: command
    name: "docker-setup"
  
  - step: 4
    type: command
    name: "setup-testing"
  
  - step: 5
    type: mcp
    name: "filesystem"
  
  - step: 6
    type: mcp
    name: "web-fetch"
  
  - step: 7
    type: setting
    name: "enable-telemetry"
  
  - step: 8
    type: hook
    name: "git/pre-commit-lint"
```

### YAML Field Reference

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | Yes | Workflow display name |
| `description` | No | Detailed workflow description |
| `tags` | No | Array of searchable tags |
| `steps` | Yes | Array of installation steps |
| `steps[].step` | Yes | Step number (for ordering) |
| `steps[].type` | Yes | Component type: `agent`, `command`, `mcp`, `setting`, `hook`, `skill` |
| `steps[].name` | Yes | Component name (kebab-case) |

## Installing from YAML

### Method 1: File Path

Save your workflow as a YAML file and reference it:

```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow workflow.yaml
```

<Warning>
**Current Directory**: The CLI looks for the YAML file relative to your current directory. Use absolute paths if needed:

```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow /path/to/workflow.yaml
```
</Warning>

### Method 2: Base64 Encoded

For remote installations or CI/CD:

```bash
# Encode workflow
YAML_CONTENT=$(cat workflow.yaml | base64)

# Install from base64
npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow "$YAML_CONTENT"
```

### Method 3: Inline YAML

For short workflows:

```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow 'name: Quick Setup
steps:
  - step: 1
    type: agent
    name: security-auditor
  - step: 2
    type: command
    name: security-scan'
```

## Creating Workflows

### Visual Workflow Builder

The easiest way to create workflows:

<Steps>

### Open the Builder

Visit [aitmpl.com/workflows](https://aitmpl.com/workflows)

### Browse Components

The left sidebar shows:
- **Agents** (grouped by category)
- **Commands** (grouped by category)
- **MCPs** (alphabetical)

Use the search bar to filter components.

### Add Components

Two methods:

1. **Drag and Drop**: Drag components from sidebar to canvas
2. **Click to Add**: Click the ➕ button next to component name

Components appear in the center canvas as workflow steps.

### Reorder Steps

Drag steps to reorder them. The step numbers update automatically.

### Set Properties

Click "Generate Workflow" and fill in:
- **Name** - Workflow display name
- **Description** - What the workflow does
- **Tags** - Comma-separated tags for discovery

### Generate Hash and YAML

The builder shows:

```bash
# Workflow Hash (for quick sharing)
npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow:#abc123def456

# YAML (for version control)
name: "My Workflow"
steps:
  - step: 1
    type: agent
    name: "security-auditor"
  ...
```

Copy either format.

</Steps>

### Manual YAML Creation

Create workflows directly in your editor:

```bash
# Create workflow file
touch .claude/workflows/my-workflow.yaml

# Edit with your favorite editor
code .claude/workflows/my-workflow.yaml
```

Add your workflow structure following the YAML format above.

## Workflow Best Practices

### 1. Name Workflows Descriptively

✅ Good:
```yaml
name: "React Frontend with TypeScript and Testing"
```

❌ Bad:
```yaml
name: "My Setup"
```

### 2. Add Comprehensive Descriptions

```yaml
name: "E-commerce Backend API"
description: |
  Complete backend setup for e-commerce API including:
  - Database integration (PostgreSQL)
  - Authentication and security
  - Payment processing setup
  - API documentation generation
  - Automated testing suite
```

### 3. Use Meaningful Tags

```yaml
tags:
  - ecommerce
  - backend
  - api
  - postgresql
  - stripe
  - authentication
```

Tags help others discover your workflow.

### 4. Order Components Logically

```yaml
steps:
  # 1. Install agents first
  - step: 1
    type: agent
    name: "backend-developer"
  
  # 2. Then commands
  - step: 2
    type: command
    name: "docker-setup"
  
  # 3. Then MCPs
  - step: 3
    type: mcp
    name: "database"
  
  # 4. Finally settings and hooks
  - step: 4
    type: setting
    name: "enable-telemetry"
```

### 5. Version Control Workflows

Store workflows in your repo:

```bash
.claude/
├── workflows/
│   ├── development.yaml
│   ├── production.yaml
│   └── testing.yaml
└── README.md
```

Document in README:

```markdown
## Development Setup

\`\`\`bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow .claude/workflows/development.yaml
\`\`\`
```

## Combining Workflows with Other Flags

Workflows can be combined with additional flags:

### Add Extra Components

```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest \
  --workflow development.yaml \
  --agent extra-agent \
  --command extra-command
```

The workflow installs first, then additional components.

### Set Installation Directory

```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest \
  --workflow development.yaml \
  --directory ./my-project
```

### Auto-Confirm

```bash
npx claude-code-templates@latest \
  --workflow development.yaml \
  --yes
```

Skips all confirmation prompts.

## Sharing Workflows

### Share Hash URLs

After creating a workflow on aitmpl.com:

```
https://aitmpl.com/workflows#abc123def456
```

Share this URL. Others can:
1. View workflow details
2. Copy the installation command
3. Install with one command

### Share YAML Files

#### Via GitHub Gist

```bash
# Create a gist
gh gist create workflow.yaml --public

# Share the gist URL
# Others can:
curl https://gist.githubusercontent.com/.../workflow.yaml | \
  npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow -
```

#### Via Git Repository

```bash
# In your repo
git add .claude/workflows/setup.yaml
git commit -m "Add Claude Code workflow"
git push

# Others can:
git clone <repo>
npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow .claude/workflows/setup.yaml
```

#### Via Package Registry

Publish workflows as npm packages:

```json package.json
{
  "name": "@yourorg/claude-workflows",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "files": ["workflows/"]
}
```

```bash
npm publish

# Others can:
npx @yourorg/claude-workflows/workflows/setup.yaml
```

## Workflow Collections

Create multiple related workflows:

```
.claude/workflows/
├── base.yaml           # Core components for all projects
├── frontend.yaml       # Frontend-specific additions
├── backend.yaml        # Backend-specific additions
└── full-stack.yaml     # Combined frontend + backend
```

Install progressively:

```bash
# Start with base
npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow .claude/workflows/base.yaml --yes

# Add frontend
npx claude-code-templates@latest --workflow .claude/workflows/frontend.yaml --yes
```

## Troubleshooting Workflows

### Workflow Hash Not Found

```bash
❌ Workflow hash "abc123def456" not found in localStorage
```

**Solution**: Workflow hashes are browser-specific. Use YAML format for sharing:

```bash
# Convert to YAML
# 1. Open aitmpl.com/workflows#abc123def456
# 2. Copy the YAML output
# 3. Save to file and share
```

### Invalid YAML Syntax

```bash
❌ Error parsing workflow YAML: Unexpected token
```

**Solution**: Validate YAML syntax:

```bash
# Use a YAML validator
npx js-yaml workflow.yaml

# Or online: https://www.yamllint.com/
```

Common issues:
- Incorrect indentation (use 2 spaces)
- Missing quotes around names with special characters
- Trailing whitespace

### Component Not Found

```bash
✅ Agent "security-auditor" installed
❌ Command "non-existent-cmd" not found
✅ MCP "filesystem" installed
```

**Solution**: Check component names:

1. Visit [aitmpl.com](https://aitmpl.com)
2. Search for the component
3. Use exact name from search results
4. Update workflow YAML

### Step Order Matters

Some components depend on others:

```yaml
# ❌ Bad: Settings before agents
steps:
  - step: 1
    type: setting
    name: "enable-telemetry"
  - step: 2
    type: agent
    name: "security-auditor"

# ✅ Good: Logical order
steps:
  - step: 1
    type: agent
    name: "security-auditor"
  - step: 2
    type: setting
    name: "enable-telemetry"
```
